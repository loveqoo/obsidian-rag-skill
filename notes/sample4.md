# Kubernetes Basics

An introduction to container orchestration with Kubernetes.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Key Concepts

### Pods

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process and can contain one or more containers.

### Services

A Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.

### Deployments

A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

See also [[Docker Containers]] for understanding containerization basics.
