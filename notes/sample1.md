# Machine Learning Basics

This is a sample note about machine learning fundamentals.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data, and makes predictions based on that data. The algorithm receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs.

Common applications include:
- Image classification
- Spam detection
- Price prediction

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning algorithms work with data that has no labels. The system tries to learn without a teacher by finding patterns and structure in the data.

Examples include:
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems
